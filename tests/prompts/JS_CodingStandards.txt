We have a particular way we do Javascript in WordPress plugins.

e.g. dialectic.js
/cacbot/src/Cacbot/dialectic.js

there is also
/cacbot/src/Cacbot/dialectic.js_src/
withing dialectic.js_src are several other function files e.g.
fetchRemoteComment.js
These interior files are functions and classes that are transpiled to dialectic.js in our custom deployment pipeline. Specifically,
we use SWC [Speedy Web Compiler] to bundle the seperate JS files into a single file for distribution. We use a combination of functional, OOP, as appropriate.
The js files can be localized by WordPress to pass information from the server to the browser.
